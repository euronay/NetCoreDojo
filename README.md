# Net Core Coding Dojo

The Net Core Dojo is my attempt at completing the Kata from [codingdojo.org](http://codingdojo.org). My aim is to create tests and starter code for each Kata. The *master* branch will contain the skeleton code and the *solutions* branch my attempts.

### Running the Tests

Run the preconfigured test task in Visual Studio Code, or from the command line run:

 ```dotnet test```

### Current Katas

- DictionaryReplacer

### TODO

- The rest!
